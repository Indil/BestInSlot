# Best In Slot Quick Start Guide

The intention of this page is to quickly get you started with Best In Slot and its features.

## Accessing the Add On

I've implemented three ways to access the add-on. By default, there's a mini-map button which looks like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/yYC72v0.png)  
You can also access the Add On by using the chat commands: **/bis** or **/bestinslot**.  
Any commands can be accessed by either using **/bis** or **/bestinslot**. For instance both **/bis help** and **/bestinslot help** will print out all commands.

## Slash Commands

There's a couple of slash commands that you can access. To read on which ones they are, type in **/bestinslot help** or **/bis help**

## The Manager

The BiS Manager is where all the magic happens. This is the place where you can set your BestInSlot list. On startup the Add On automatically selects the highest available raid tier and difficulty. You can make a BestInSlot list for every raid tier, for every difficulty, for every specialization.  
For instance, a shaman can have 3 specializations for Highmaul Heroic, one for Elemental, Enhancement and Restoration.  

The manager will show you a copy of your inventory screen. For each slot you can set a BestInSlot item. The Add On uses the loot list of that list, and checks if you're eligible for that loot in that slot. You'll get a list with items that you're eligible to roll for the selected raid tier, difficulty and specialization.  
For more information about using the BiS Manager you can hover over the text at the bottom of the window.  
The manager should look like this:

## I've setup my BestInSlot list, what is the advantage of using this Add On?

First off, you can easily check what you need from an instance on a per boss basis. How this looks is seen on the screenshot below:

You can make custom BiS lists if you need more than the standard one for each specc.

You can export your BiS lists to WoWhead or SimulationCraft.

## Cool. Can this somehow help seeing who needs which item too?

Yes it can! With the Request BiS panel can you automatically fetch your raids, guild members or a whisper target's BiS lists and see how many people that need an item from each boss.

You can also report your BiS list to chat channels. You can do that at the bottom of the Overview window. This looks like the screenshot below:

## There's more...

There's more that's especially interesting for guilds to use! I'll post those news as soon.
